## What is Cryptoshark?

CryptoShark is a bot available on Telegram. 
It allows you to **get the values of any crypto-currency in real-time in US dollar and Euro**. All the data is fetched on Coin Market Cap, the world's most trusted source for crypto market.

It can also show the most and least efficient crypto currencies over the last hour, 24 hours or 7 days. You now have all the info in hand to make your exchanges a success.

## Where can I find it?

If you want more information about cryptoShark, I wrote an article where I explain my motivations and how the bot works.
